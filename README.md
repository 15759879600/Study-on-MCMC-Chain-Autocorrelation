# Study-on-MCMC-Chain-Autocorrelation

1. Investigated the impact of proposal distribution variance on MCMC chain autocorrelation and parameter estimation accuracy.
2. Implemented Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, varying step size and variance, and analyzed effective sample size (ESS) and confidence interval width.
3. Evaluated autocorrelation effects to optimize sampling efficiency and statistical inference in MCMC applications.
